question: "Astro visits Planet X and is amazed by their unique number system. The number system on Planet X follows these rules:
1. A number can only consist of the digits A, B, C, D and E.
2. The value of each digit is defined as follows:
    * A = 1
    * B = 10
    * C = 100
    * D = 1000
    * E = 10000
To convert a number to its decimal format, they use these rules:
1. Sum the values of all digits.
2. If a digit has a strictly greater value to its right (not necessarily immediately after it), the digit takes a negative sign; otherwise, it retains a positie sign.

For example:
* For the number EAA, the conversion is 10000 + 1 + 1 = 10002.
* For the number EAAD, the conversion is 10000 - 1 - 1 + 1000 = 10998.

Astro wonders what the maximum number he can achieve is if he is allowed to change at most one digit in the number.

Please the function getMaxNumber which takes following input:
1. s = String representing a number in Planet X number system, s consists of A, B, C, D and E only."
---

# Returns
Integer which is the maximum number in decimal format he can get if he is allowed to change at most one digit in the number.

# Constraints
1. s consists of A, B, C, D and E.
2. 1 <= length(s) <= 1e5

## Example

### Input
```cpp
AAAA
```

### Output
```cpp
10003
```

## Explanation
Replace the first A with E = EAAA and it's value is 10003.
