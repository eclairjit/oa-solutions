name: "VM Pricing"
companyName: "Salesforce"
question: "A cloud service provider offers quantity discounts based on the number of virtual machines a customer needs. Their offerings vary from 2 to 2000 instances.
When pricing is requested, the customer's representative refers to a list of past pricing. Given a list of past price quotes
and the number of instances a customer needs, determine the pre-instance price for the customer.

The method for determining price is as follows: \n
- If the number of instances needed is exactly the same as the quantity for a prior customer, the unit price is that price. \n
- If there is a price for a larger number ans a price for a smaller number of instances, linearly interppolate the price of the
  quantity needed from the unit prices for the closest smaller and larger quantities. \n
- If the quantities for which there is past data are all smaller or all larger that the amount needed, then linearly extrapolate
  the unit price from the 2 points closest to the quantity needed. \n
- If the database only has 1 quantity, that is the price per unit. \n
- Sometimes, price quotes lapse. When that happens, the old pricing is overwritten with either a 0 or a negative number.
  The quantities associated with zero or negative unit prices must be diregarded. \n

# Input
- The first line contains an integer, n, the number of instances needed.
- The second line contains an integer, m, the size of the array instances.
- Each line i of the m subsequent lines (where 0<=i<m) contains an integer that describes instances[i].
- The next line again contains the integer, m, the size of the array price.
- Each line i of the m subsequent lines (where 0<=i<m) contains a floating point number that describes price[i].
  
# Constraints
- 2<=n<=2000
- 1<=m<=100
- The instances will be given in non-decreasing order.
- The answer should be rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.
